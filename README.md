# pargo
## A library for parallel programming in Go

Package pargo provides functions and data structures for expressing
parallel algorithms. While Go is primarily designed for concurrent
programming, it is also usable to some extent for parallel
programming, and this library provides convenince functionality to
turn otherwise sequential algorithms into parallel algorithms, with
the goal to improve performance.
